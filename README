This design is based on http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35438,
but I redesigned it using OpenSCAD to fit it to my needs.

You can use ./gen.sh to generate the STL files.
Of course you will need OpenSCAD for this.

This was designed for the "[Sintron] 2004 LCD Smart Display Controller Module
with Adapter for 3D Printer Controller RAMPS 1.4 Arduino Mega Pololu Shield
Arduino RepRap".
